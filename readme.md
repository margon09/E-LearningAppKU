# E-learning platform for remote teaching at KU

In order to install this app you need to have node installed locally on your PC.
This app was first developed for processing/java, but to be able to have it on the KU webpage it is re-written for P5.js.
It allows to train teachers how to use hardware and software as well as plan a teaching session, as the real installation has several possibilities, e.g. to zoom on a specific item during anatomy class or e.g. to switch between different screens, depending on the needs, etc. All this possibilities are trained interactivily in this app.
